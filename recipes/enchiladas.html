        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced green onions</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 large cooked chicken breast halves, diced</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach - thawed, drained, and squeezed dry</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>5 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>2 (10 ounce) cans enchilada sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>  

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir green
            onions and garlic in butter until fragrant and softened, about
            2 minutes. Stir chicken, spinach, chili powder, black pepper, and
            salt into the green onion mixture and cook until heated through, about
            5 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix ricotta cheese, sour cream, 1 cup
            Monterey Jack cheese, and 1 cup of mozzarella cheese into chicken
            mixture until thoroughly combined. Reserve remaining Monterey Jack
            and mozzarella cheeses for topping.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place tortillas into a plastic bag, seal bag, and microwave on high
            until warm and soft, 30 to 45 seconds. Spoon about 3/4 cup of chicken
            filling down the center of each tortilla in a line. Roll tortillas
            around filling and place with seam sides down into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour enchilada sauce over filled enchiladas and sprinkle the
            remaining 1/2 cup of Monterey Jack and mozzarella cheeses over the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbling and cheese topping
            is browned at the edges, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
